# NAV Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning to detect abnormal Net Asset Value (NAV) patterns in mutual funds. Logistic Regression (supervised) and Local Outlier Factor (unsupervised) models are used to identify potential NAV manipulation from financial performance indicators.

## Objectives
- Detect suspicious NAV behavior
- Apply supervised and unsupervised ML methods
- Support fraud monitoring in fund accounting

## Techniques Used
- Logistic Regression
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Data Preprocessing & Scaling
- Accuracy and Confusion Matrix Evaluation

## Tools & Libraries
Python, Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Le
